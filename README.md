## Insights
- Recruitment practices favor male candidates.
- Women are underrepresented in mid-level management, creating a bottleneck for leadership roles.
- Workplace culture and higher turnover rates among women contribute to slow progress.

## Root Causes for Slow Progress in Achieving Gender Balance
- Recruitment practices may unintentionally favor male candidates, especially for leadership roles.
- Limited outreach to diverse talent pools could lead to fewer female candidates.
- Women are underrepresented in mid-level management, creating a bottleneck for promotion to executive roles.
- Bias in performance evaluations may influence decisions about promotions.
- A male-dominated leadership environment can unintentionally create a less inclusive culture for women.
- Lack of mentorship and sponsorship opportunities for women may hinder their career advancement.
- Higher turnover rates among women might indicate challenges like work-life balance, lack of flexible policies, or dissatisfaction with career progression.
- Leadership teams may lack awareness of unconscious bias or may not prioritize diversity as a strategic goal.
- Gender disparities in performance ratings could reflect inherent biases in assessment criteria or processes.

## Recommendations to Address Root Causes and Improve Gender Balance
